 LaTeX Demo for IEEE
 
As is known, if a researcher wants to write an IEEE paper in LaTex, the official demo [LaTeX Templates for IEEE](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf) downloaded from the IEEE official site is helpful. 

However, the official demo contains little examples to as a reference, e.g. keywords, embeded pictures, equations or external reference file. As a result, it is still not easy to use readily for a beginner.  

So I made this [LaTeX Demo for IEEE](https://codeload.github.com/wolfbrother/A-LaTeX-Demo-for-IEEE/zip/master).
